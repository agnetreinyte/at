# Hello
HELLO cruel world of web programming!
# What my project is about
I have actually <strong>NO</strong> idea.
<br>But I'm really into the idea of multiple user black(white)board kind of gallery/notepad/event planner/stuff sharing platform.
<br>A user can be included in many boards.
<br>It includes widgets such as:
<ul>
    <li>event planner with a callendar, comment section etc</li>
    <li>sticky notes with a photo/video uploading or linking possibility</li>
    <li>drawing and text tools</li>
    <li>music player</li>
    <li>loads of more cool stuff</li>
</ul>
<p>
I am really trying to come up with all the specific ideas, so the list is to be continued.
</p>
<br> So basically it would be a web version of a kitchen fridge: leave all kinds of messages so people that have access could read/respond. It would allow drawing/writing messages in real time.
<br> All of this kind of boards that exist are more on a proffesional level, for work or for studies, or offer only drawing. I want to make commercial version of it. I'm looking at something that would basically connect your friends FB walls into one.
